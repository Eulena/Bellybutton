b. Sqlite database file and SQLAlchemy used to create DFs

c. Template which holds the index.html for the dashboard landing page. Bootstrap grid system used to create the structure of the dashboard page.

d. Plotly.js to create interactive dashboard charts.

e. Created an app in Heroku and connected my github repository to Heroku for web application deployment.
